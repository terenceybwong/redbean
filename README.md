# RedBean performance benchmark

The benchmark is a rough test on the performance of RedBean against plain SQL statements.

To run the benchmark, create database on MySQL 5.7.
```
CREATE DATABASE redbean;
USE redbean;
CREATE USER redbean IDENTIFIED BY 'redbean';
GRANT ALL ON redbean.* to redbean;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Run the benchmark from command line:

```bash
php -e src/benchmark-update.php
```
